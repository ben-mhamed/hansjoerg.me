# Projects and Achievements

- My **academic work** is concerned with the development and application of statistical models for questionnaire data. My research was [published](https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=de&user=ywhQbsEAAAAJ) in scientific journals such as *Multivariate Behavior Research*, and I received **awards** such as the [Bojanovsky Award](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/newsroom/presse/pressemitteilungen/2019/juli/absolventenfeier-sowi/) in 2019.

- I developed the **R packages** [mpt2irt](https://github.com/hplieninger/mpt2irt) and [ItemResponseTrees](https://github.com/hplieninger/ItemResponseTrees) that implement specific statistical models for questionnaire data.

- I tought Bachelor and Master courses on statistics and questionnaire design and built a [shiny app](https://hplieninger.shinyapps.io/ShinyICCs/) for teaching item response theory.

- I conducted internal **R workshops** for colleagues and served as a consultant for fellow academics with statistical questions.

- I have a **blog** with 200 visits per week, where I post tutorials and analyses from time to time: https://hansjoerg.me.

- I work as a **freelance data analyst** and have been a statistical consultant for a study with patients suffering from dementia.

# Methods

Psychologists mostly work either with survey data or experimental data. Therefore, I am trained and experienced in the following methods:

- **Study design** of experimental and non-experimental studies  
  (e.g., A/B testing)

- **Questionnaire design**, item development, test construction

<!-- - [Web scraping](https://hansjoerg.me/2018/07/17/web-scraping-world-cup/) -->

<!-- - Simulation studies -->

<br>

After data collection, typical projects of mine involve the following tasks:

- **Data wrangling**: Bringing raw data into a format suitable for subsequent analyses ([example](https://github.com/hplieninger/hansjoerg.me/tree/master/static/uploads/handball-data.md))

- **Reporting** using presentations, blog posts, dashboards, etc.

- **Visualization** and **modeling**

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Data Wrangling -->

<!-- - I am accustomed to import data in various formats using mainly R but also SQL. -->

<!-- - Even though many people complain about it, I actually like data wrangling. I use tidyverse packages for tasks such as cleansing, filtering, extracting, joining, aggregating, and summarizing. -->

<!-- - Last year, I made a small [blog post](https://hansjoerg.me/2018/07/17/web-scraping-world-cup/) about red cards in soccer. Therein, I scraped data from the internet and transformed it into an appropriate form that I could then use for plotting. -->

---

# Data Visualization

I mostly use ggplot2 for visualizations. Here is an example, where I use the gganimate package to plot the increase in Wikipedia articles over time.

--

```{r gganimate, cache = TRUE, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("gganimate")

load(here::here("static/data/wiki_data.rda"))

p1 <- ggplot(wiki_data, aes(month, total.total, col = Language, group = Language)) +
    transition_reveal(month) +
    geom_line(size = 1, show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_point(size = 2, show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_segment(aes(xend = max(wiki_data$month) + 60^2*24*31*15, yend = total.total),
                 linetype = 2, colour = 'grey', show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_text(aes(x = max(wiki_data$month) + 60^2*24*31*20, label = Language),
              hjust = 0, show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_color_viridis_d(end = .8) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    coord_cartesian(clip = 'off') +
    labs(title = 'Impressive Growth of Wikipedia from 2001 to 2019',
         subtitle = "Year: {lubridate::year(frame_along)}",
         y = "Number of Articles", x = "Year", 
         caption = "Source: https://stats.wikimedia.org/v2/") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(plot.margin = margin(5.5, 40, 5.5, 5.5), 
          plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey"),
          plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#fdf6e3", color = "#fdf6e3"), 
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#fdf6e3", color = "#fdf6e3"))

animate(p1, nframes = 50, fps = 6, width = 700, height = 400, res = 100)
```

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Data Reports -->

<!-- - I like to tell stories from data using presentations, blog posts, dashboards, reports, or simply personal communication. -->

<!-- - I use R Markdown for all of these. -->

<!-- - For example, this presentation including all the plots  was generated from a single R Markdown document using R/RStudio and the xaringan package. -->

<!-- - I've also built [shiny apps](https://hplieninger.shinyapps.io/ShinyICCs/), for example, for teaching item response theory. -->

# Modeling / Machine Learning

- From Bachelor to PhD, I received extensive training in statistics.

- I have routine in using the following models and techniques:

### Models

- **Regression** (e.g., [linear](https://hansjoerg.me/2018/07/10/contrasts-in-anova-and-regression/), Poisson, [Beta](https://hansjoerg.me/2019/05/10/regression-modeling-with-proportion-data-part-1/), random-effects)

- **Classification** (e.g., logistic regression, discriminant analysis, SVM)

- **Unsupervised learning** (e.g., factor analysis, PCA, [item response theory](https://hansjoerg.me/2018/04/23/rasch-in-r-tutorial/), structural equation modeling, k-Means clustering)

### Techniques

- [Cross-validation](https://hansjoerg.me/2019/05/10/regression-modeling-with-proportion-data-part-1/), bootstrap, multiple imputation, feature selection

- Bayesian and frequentist inference
