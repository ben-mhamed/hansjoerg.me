<p>Recently, I sent my dissertation as a PDF file to a copy shop and got an email back that I had not embedded all fonts and that they won’t print it for me.
What?
So instead of celebrating the submission, I had to search online for <em>pdf latex “font embedding”</em>, and this blog post is a summary of that afternoon.</p>
<div id="what-is-font-embedding" class="section level2">
<h2>What is Font Embedding</h2>
<p>In order to display or print a PDF, the system has to know which fonts it should use.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the font used in the PDF is available on the system, it is able to handle it correctly (e.g., Arial).</li>
<li>If the font used in the PDF is not available on the system but is embedded in the PDF, the system is able to handle it correctly.</li>
<li>If the font is not available and not embedded, the system will guess what font to use for display/print and this may or may not work. This <a href="http://wiki.opf-labs.org/download/attachments/101613571/fonts_notembedded.jpg?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1430223649000">link</a> shows an extreme example of what might happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Embedding fonts is probably not crucial for non-exotic fonts on non-exotic devices/printers.
However, if you want to make sure that your PDF is correctly displayed or printed on any possible device, fonts should be embedded.
Such devices could be, for example, a printer of a copy shop, an exotic device of a student, or a person with an otherwise different setup (e.g., someone in the year 2076 in Tanzania).</p>

<div id="problem-r-does-not-embed-fonts" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem: R does not embed fonts</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>pdf()
plot(cars)
dev.off()</code></pre>
<p>R does not embed fonts when producing a PDF via <code>pdf()</code> as above. Thus, if you compile a PDF with LaTeX and include R plots (i.e., PDFs), LaTeX cannot embed the fonts of the plots, and then you finally have a PDF with some fonts not embedded. LaTeX itself seems to embed all fonts automatically, so if you don’t include any plots, you don’t have to worry.</p>
<p>You can check whether fonts are embedded with most PDF readers and something along the lines of Properties -&gt; Fonts.</p>
</div>
<div id="solution-in-r-use-cairo_pdf" class="section level2">
<h2>Solution in R: Use cairo_pdf()</h2>
<p>If you wish to embed the fonts of your R plots, you have the following options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not produce vector graphics via <code>pdf()</code> but images via <code>png()</code>, for example. This is probably not the desired solution because of quality, but it circumvents the problem of font embedding.</li>
<li>Produce vector graphics not via <code>pdf()</code> but via <code>cairo_pdf()</code>. This will embed the fonts automatically, and LaTeX will subsequently embed these fonts, too. This is the workflow that I recommend.</li>
<li>Postscript may also be an alternative (e.g., <code>cairo_ps()</code>), but I don’t know much about postscript.</li>
<li>You may also embed fonts post hoc. R has a function <code>embedFonts()</code>, and the package <strong>extrafont</strong> provides a wrapper, for example, <code>extrafont::embed_fonts(&quot;f1.pdf&quot;, outfile=&quot;f1_embedded.pdf&quot;)</code>.<br />
BTW: You may use any font (available on your system) in any R plot with the <strong>extrafont</strong> package.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="solution-with-completed-pdf" class="section level2">
<h2>Solution With Completed PDF</h2>
<p>If you already have a PDF with unembedded fonts and want to embed the fonts post hoc, things are different and may be a bit more difficult. What worked for me in a one or two test cases are the following solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use ghostscript via <code>embedFonts()</code> or the <strong>extrafont</strong> package as stated above.</li>
<li>You may also call ghostscript directly (rather than from R) as described in a <a href="https://www.karlrupp.net/2016/01/embed-all-fonts-in-pdfs-latex-pdflatex/">blog post by Karl Rupp</a>, close to the end of the post. What worked for me is the following command in a Windows Command Prompt:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>gswin64c -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dEmbedAllFonts=true -sOutputFile=C:\...\my_plot_embedded.pdf -f C:\...\my_plot.pdf</code></pre>
<p>These solutions are certainly dependent on the fact that you have the fonts, which you want to embed, installed on your computer.</p>
