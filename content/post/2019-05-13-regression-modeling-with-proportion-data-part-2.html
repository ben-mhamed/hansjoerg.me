description: "This tutorial on modeling proportions/ratios in R reveals that attendance in the Handball-Bundesliga rose by 7 % after the world championship. Includes generalized linear models, tidyverse, plots."
summary: "In the first part of this post, I demonstrated how beta and quasi-binomial regression can be used with dependent variables that are proportions or ratios such as the attendance rates of the German Handball-Bundesliga. In the second part, I want to investigate whether attendance increased after the World Championship that took place in January 2019 in Denmark and Germany."

<p>In the <a href="/2019/05/10/regression-modeling-with-proportion-data-part-1">first part</a> of this post, I demonstrated how beta and quasi-binomial regression can be used with dependent variables that are proportions or ratios. I applied these models to attendance rates of the German Handball-Bundesliga. In the second part, I want to investigate whether attendance increased after the World Championship that took place in January 2019 in Denmark and Germany (with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Men&#39;s_Handball_Championship">new spectator record</a>). It is often suggested that such tournaments have an impact beyond the event itself, and the following analyses are aimed to shed light on this for the present example.</p>

<p>First, let’s compare the attendance rates in the first half of the season (Sep–Dec) with those from the second half (Feb–Jun) descriptively. As seen below, the attendance rates are always a little bit higher in the second half, but the difference is much more pronounced in the current season. Before the World Championship, the average attendance rate was 76 % which rose to 84 % after the World Championship.</p>
<p>Even though this looks like there was some effect, these descriptive values should be treated with caution because several variables need to be controlled for in an appropriate statistical model as done below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df1 %&gt;%

<h2>Analyses: Beta and Quasi-Binomial Regression</h2>
<p>The analyses reported in the <a href="/2019/05/10/regression-modeling-with-proportion-data-part-1">first post</a> revealed that a quasi-binomial and a beta model fit the data best. (The beta was slightly inferior but it has the advantage that prediction intervals—if desired—can be obtained.) In the following, I fit these two models and include, among other predictors, the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>half2</code> captures differences between the first half of the season (Oct–Dec) and the second half (Feb-Jun) across all three seasons.</li>
<li><code>year2</code> captures differences between the second (2017/18) and the first (2016/17) season, and <code>ix1</code> is the interaction of <code>half2</code> and <code>year2</code>.</li>
<li><code>year3</code> captures differences between the third season (2018/19) on the one hand and the earlier two seasons on the other hand via Helmert coding. <code>ix2</code> is the interaction of <code>half2</code> and <code>year3</code>.</li>
<li>The variables <code>Oct</code>, <code>Nov</code>, etc. control differences between months within a half and are of secondary importance (see also my <a href="https://github.com/hplieninger/hansjoerg.me/tree/master/static/uploads/handball-data.md">R code for data wrangling</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thus, a sizable, positive effect of <code>ix2</code> indicates that the attendance rate after the World Championship in 2019 was larger compared to the attendance rates in the same time period in the two seasons before.</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>res1 &lt;- list()
res1$Beta &lt;- 
    betareg(y ~ home_team + away_team + weekday + Oct + Nov + Dec + Mar + Apr + May + 
                half2 + year2 + year3 + ix1 + ix2 | home_team, data = df2)

res1$Quasibinomial &lt;- 
    glm(perc ~ home_team + away_team + weekday +
            Oct + Nov + Dec + Mar + Apr + May + 
            half2 + year2 + year3 + ix1 + ix2, data = df2,
        family = quasibinomial(logit), weights = capacity)</code></pre>

<div id="results" class="section level2">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The coefficients from both models shown below indicate that attendance rates are larger in the second half of the season (by a value of ca. 0.3 logits). Furthermore, attendance rates were largest in 2016/17 and then slightly decreased (as indicated by the negative signs for <code>year2</code> and <code>year3</code>). <strong>Most importantly, there is a positive interaction effect <code>ix2</code> indicating that attendance after January was higher in 2019 compared to the years before. It seems reasonable to conclude that this increase is due to the World Championship that took place in January 2019.</strong> The effect is larger in the quasi-binomial model than in the beta model. Furthermore, note that p-values are of secondary importance here, because the data are in fact population data (i.e., no sampling error).</p>

<p>The plot nicely illustrates the championship effect. The green lines represent the predictions for the <em>Observed</em> data, whereas the blue lines represent the predictions that were <em>Expected</em> for these matches based on the data from 2016/17 and 2017/18. As you can see, we expected a decline in February 2019 (blue line), since such a pattern was consistently observed in 2017 and 2018. However, attendance stayed stable in 2019 (green line). Thus, the yellow area indicates the relative increase in attendance after the World Championship in January 2019.</p>

<h3>Model Comparison</h3>
<p>The analyses in the <a href="/2019/05/10/regression-modeling-with-proportion-data-part-1">first post</a> already revealed that the quasi-binomial model may describe the data better than the beta model. Herein, I compare these models again for the present data. The results below confirm the finding from the first post: RMSE and MAE are lower and R squared is higher for the quasi-binomial model.</p>

<h3>Effect Size</h3>
<p>To quantify the championship effect, I average over all matches after January 2019 and compare the green and the blue line in the plot (i.e., predictions for observed data compared to expected data if no effect was present). As seen below, the results depends to some extent on the model even though it is a sizable effect for both. According to the beta regression model, the attendance rate per match increased by 4 % after the championship and by 7 % according to the quasi-binomial model. This corresponds to an average of 184 and 315, respectively, additional spectators per match.</p>
