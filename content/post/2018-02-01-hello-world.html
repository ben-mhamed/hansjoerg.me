<p>Hello, my name is Hansjörg, and I am a postdoctoral researcher in the psychology department at the University of Mannheim, Germany. I want to start blogging today, because I always wanted to, and because one of my R heroes Yihui Xie made this possible through his R package <strong>blogdown</strong>:</p>
{{% tweet "943194437076897792" %}}
<p>This blog is about …</p>
<ul>
<li>things I learned, to make it simpler for other people to learn the same thing quicker,</li>
<li>things I learned, to make it simpler for me to do the same thing quicker next time,</li>
<li>things I love, to make it simpler for others to love them, too,</li>
<li>things I do, to make it simpler for you to get in touch with me.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the motto of this blog comes from one of my favorite R packages, <strong>fortunes</strong>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fortunes::fortune(&quot;done it.&quot;)
#&gt; 
#&gt; It was simple, but you know, it&#39;s always simple when you&#39;ve done it.
