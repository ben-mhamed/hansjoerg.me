<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Hansjörg Plieninger, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the psychology department at the University of Mannheim, Germany. I love data science and I love R. From an academic perspective, I am an expert in psychometrics, item response theory, structural equation modeling, and multilevel modeling; more specifically, I use this machinery to investigate response styles (e.g., tendency to give extreme responses). From a data-science perspective, I am an expert in dealing with survey data, Likert-type data and the like.</p>
